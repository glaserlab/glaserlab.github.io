<!-- *We have a broad range of projects that involve using machine learning and statistical analyses to better understand neural activity.* <br /> -->

***Our lab works closely with experimental collaborators to develop machine learning tools that lead to scientific insights*** <br /><br />


### Main Interests

* In the **machine learning** space, our main interest is developing more interpretable machine learning methods, rather than having methods that work as black boxes. <br />
* In the **neuroscience** space, our main interests are to understand:
   * The interaction between different neural populations (brain areas, cell types, etc)
   * How neural activity flexibly drives behavior across a wide range of conditions
   * How dynamics of neural activity differ across behaviors, diseases, and internal states <br /><br />


### Current Projects <br />
<!-- Our current projects fall into 3 general categories: -->
* Developing more interpretable dimensionality reduction techniques to disentangle neural activity related to different neural computations and behaviors.
* Building interpretable decoding models to link neural activity with behavior.
* Creating methods to better understand the interaction between multiple recorded neural populations.

#### Additional Projects
  - Collaborating with Yu Mu from Misha Ahrens's lab to better understand the role of (and interplay between) neurons and astroglia in different behavioral states in the larval zebrafish.
  - Collaborating with Margot Elmaleh from Michael Long's lab to better understand neural activity in songbird motor (singing) areas during sleep.
  - Collaborating with Xinyi Deng to develop hidden markov models to understand compression in hippocampal replay.
  - Collaborating with Mario DiPoppa to model the interaction between cell types in visual cortex.
  - Collaborating with Matt Whiteway to develop methods for automatically detecting changes in neural correlation structure.

I'm excited to be working with a lot of great collaborators!
