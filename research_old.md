*I have a broad range of projects that involve using machine learning and statistical analyses to better understand neural activity.* <br />


### Main Interests

* In the **machine learning** space, my main interest is developing more interpretable machine learning methods, rather than having methods that work as black boxes. <br /><br />
* In the **neuroscience** space, my main interests are to understand:
   * The interaction between different neural populations (brain areas, cell types, etc)
   * How neural activity flexibly drives behavior across a wide range of conditions
   * How dynamics of neural activity differ across behaviors, diseases, and internal states <br /><br />


### Current Projects <br />

* Developing more interpretable dimensionality reduction techniques to disentangle neural activity related to different neural computations and behaviors. 
* Developing methods to better understand the interaction between multiple recorded neural populations. For example, see our recent NeurIPS [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/10/22/2020.10.21.349282.full.pdf).
* Collaborating with Mark Churchland's lab to understand the flexibility of spinal motor neuron recruitment and activity across a wide range of motor tasks. See our recent [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.442653v2.full.pdf). <br /><br />

#### Additional Projects
  - Collaborating with Yu Mu from Misha Ahrens's lab to better understand the role of (and interplay between) neurons and astroglia in different behavioral states in the larval zebrafish.
  - Collaborating with Margot Elmaleh from Michael Long's lab to better understand neural activity in songbird motor (singing) areas during sleep.
  - Collaborating with Xinyi Deng to develop hidden markov models to understand compression in hippocampal replay.
  - Collaborating with Mario DiPoppa to model the interaction between cell types in visual cortex.
  - Collaborating with Matt Whiteway to develop methods for automatically detecting changes in neural correlation structure.

I'm excited to be working with a lot of great collaborators!
