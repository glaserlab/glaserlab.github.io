### My Lab
* I'm very excited to be starting my lab in Northwestern's Neurology Department on September 1, 2022!
* My research focuses on developing interpretable machine learning tools to better understand neuroscience data. See my [Research](https://jglaser2.github.io/research) and [Publications](https://jglaser2.github.io/publication) sections for more.
* I will be recruiting postdocs and students, so please reach out if you are interested.


### About Me
* I'm currently a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) and Department of Statistics. I work in the labs of [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) and [John Cunningham](http://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/).
* I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at Northwestern University, in the lab of [Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com/). I then continued my research in the Kording lab (now at UPenn) as a postdoctoral researcher. 
* As an undergraduate, I majored in Physics and Math at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
