### Background
* I was a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) and Department of Statistics. I worked in the labs of [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) and [John Cunningham](http://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/).
* I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at Northwestern University, in the lab of [Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com/). I then continued my research in the Kording lab (now at UPenn) as a postdoctoral researcher.
* As an undergraduate, I majored in Physics and Math at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
